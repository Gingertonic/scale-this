# Scale This

## Hello! Welcome to Scale This. This is a web application for discovering musical scales and tracking your progress.

At a minimum, users can:
  + Create an account, login and logout
  + See a list of scales
  + Search the library for scales they are interested in
  + Mark scales that they are interested in learning
  + Mark scales they know
  + Add new scales (they can be public or private)
  + Edit scales they have made
  + See a page for each public scale and any of their own private scales
  + See a personal scale library with all the scales they have marked as known, learning or to learn in the future
  + Delete scales from their own scale library

Future functionality may include:
  + Follow other users and share new scales in private groups
  + See a tailored news feed of new scales made by users they have followed
  + Search for other users who are using the app
  + Visualise the scales
  + Hear audio versions of the scales
  + Randomise the scale order to generate new melody snippets for practice ideas
  + Randomise the scale order in accordance to the ascending and descending rules where applicable

## Installation instructions

To run this app on a local server:
  1. In a bash terminal of your choice run:
    + `git clone git@github.com:Gingertonic/scale-this.git` to use SSH or
    + `git clone https://github.com/Gingertonic/scale-this.git` to use HTTPS
  2. Run `cd scale-this`
  3. Run `rails s` and navigate to the address provided (Usually `127.0.0.1:3000`)
    + if a port number is given instead go to `http://localhost:<port>/` (Usually `http://localhost:3000`)
  4. Play!
    + You can make you own account or you can use these credentials to log in as a pre-made user:
      + username: `gingertonic` / password: `password`

   - If you encounter any problems or cannot access the gingertonic test account, run these steps after step 2 above
    3. run `bundle install`
    4. Run `rake db:seed`
    5. Back to step 3 as above (run `rails s`)


## This is created for a Flatiron School Portfolio Project

Skills shown include:
  + MVC application models
  + ActiveRecord and SQL
  + Ruby on Rails framework
  + OAuth authentication
  + Object orientation
  + HTML, ERB & CSS
  + RESTful routing
  + DRY principles
  + TDD & BDD using Rspec and Cabypara

The requirements for this project are:
  1. Use the Ruby on Rails framework.

  2. Your models must include a has_many, a belongs_to, and a has_many :through relationship. You can include more models to fill out your domain, but there must be at least a model acting as a join table for the has_many through. Also, make sure that the join table contains at least one user submittable attribute; for example: rides with tickets or appointments with times.

  3. Your models should include reasonable validations for the simple attributes. You don't need to add every possible validation or duplicates, such as presence and a minimum length, but the models should defend against invalid data.

  4. You must include at least one class level ActiveRecord scope methods. To some extent these class scopes can be added to power a specific individual feature, such as "My Overdue Tasks" in a TODO application, scoping all tasks for the user by a datetime scope for overdue items, @user.tasks.overdue. Reports make for a good usage of class scopes, such as "Most Valuable Cart by Customer" where the code would implement a Cart.most_valuable and Cart.by_customer which could be combined as Cart.most_valuable.by_customer(@customer).

  5. Your application must provide a standard user authentication, including signup, login, logout, and passwords. You can use Devise but given the complexity of that system, you should also feel free to roll your own authentication logic.

  6. Your authentication system should allow login from some other service. Facebook, twitter, foursquare, github, etc...

  7. You must make use of a nested resource with the appropriate RESTful URLs. Additionally, your nested resource must provide a form that relates to the parent resource. Imagine an application with user profiles. You might represent a person's profile via the RESTful URL of /profiles/1, where 1 is the primary key of the profile. If the person wanted to add pictures to their profile, you could represent that as a nested resource of /profiles/1/pictures, listing all pictures belonging to profile 1. The route /profiles/1/pictures/new would allow me to upload a new picture to profile 1. Focus on making a working application first and then adding more complexity. Making a nested URL resource like '/divisions/:id/teams/new' is great. Having a complex nested resource like 'countries/:id/sports/:id/divisions/:id/teams/new' is going to make this much harder on you.

  8. Your forms should correctly display validation errors. Your fields should be enclosed within a fields_with_errors class and error messages describing the validation failures must be present within the view.

  9. Your application must be, within reason, a DRY (Do-Not-Repeat-Yourself) rails app. Logic present in your controllers should be encapsulated as methods in your models. Your views should use helper methods and partials to be as logic-less as possible. Follow patterns in the Rails Style Guide and the Ruby Style Guide.

  10. Do not use scaffolding to build your project. Your goal here is to learn. Scaffold is a way to get up and running quickly, but learning a lot is not one of the benefits of scaffolding. Thatâ€™s why we do not allow the use of scaffolding for projects.
